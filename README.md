# SoundShift
SoundShift is a powerful tool that automates the transfer of playlists between various music streaming platforms. It fetches song metadata from a source music service, searches for matching tracks on the destination platform, and adds them to a new playlistâ€”seamlessly bridging the gap between different music ecosystems.
